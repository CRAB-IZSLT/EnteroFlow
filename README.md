# EnteroFlow is developed by the National Reference Laboratory for Antimicrobial Resistance (NRL-AR) in Italy. 
## At the moment is still under development and will be available soon. Please send an email to elena.diaconu@izslt.com to be informed when it becomes available.


# Purpose

Enteroflow is a bioinformatics workflow designed to automate and execute an in-depth characterization of E. faecium/faecalis from short-read sequencing. 
It has been thought for the “end-to-end” analysis of raw data, by efficiently coordinating raw data collection, quality control, de-novo assembly, sequence-typing, and genomic characterization tools for virulence and AMR (Antimicrobic Resistance) detection.
Specifically, it features mining for antibiotic resistance genes and replicons, virulence factors, resistance-associated point mutations, as well as the Multi-locus Sequence Typing for each isolate.

Finally, Enteroflow provides the specialized user with an interactive report that gives an overview of the genomic results and facilitates the reporting phase.


### Who we are

The National Reference Laboratory for Antimicrobial Resistance (NRL-AR) in Italy, at IZSLT, has in recent years made considerable effort in programming monitoring and reporting activities concerning antimicrobial resistance in the veterinary field. It has a ‘One Health’ perspective and functions for the benefit of animal health and veterinary public health. It operates with the help of a national network, mainly consisting Veterinary Public Institutes Network (IIZZSS – Experimental Animal Disease Prevention Institutes), the National Reference Laboratories for zoonotic bacterial agents, and collaborates with the Istituto Superiore della Sanità (National Institute of Health). It is also part of an international network that monitors and harmonizes analytical methods, as well as reports and interprets monitoring data for the benefit of public health in the EU Member State, Italy, and the European Commission.
